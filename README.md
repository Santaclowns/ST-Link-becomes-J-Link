This is a modified version of [SEGGER STLinkReflash utility](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink#STLink_Reflash)https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink#STLink_Reflash).

You will probably have to downgrade your St-Link to an older driver. Tested on clone using: [STSW-LINK007 2.36.26 version](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link007.html).

**How to:**

3. run STLinkReflash, follow instructions.
4. Done

MacOS/Linux:
1. Don't know, was originally made for Windows only
